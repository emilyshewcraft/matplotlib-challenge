- Pie chart showing distribution of female versus male mice
- Boxplots and outlier values for four selected drug regimens
- Line graph showing observed tumor volume over time for one seleted mouse
- Scatter plot showing correlation between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for one selected drug regimen
